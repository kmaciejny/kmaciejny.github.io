My experience includes an internship at Goldman Sachs, where I focused on derivatives compliance and large data automation, and a role as associate financial advisor at Westco Financial Group, a boutique wealth management firm, focusing on assisting the portfolio manager in research. I am also preparing for a role on a commodities physical trading desk, deepening my expertise in futures and options, particularly in the oil markets.

I have engaged in extensive research through competitions like the CFA Institute Research Challenge and the College Fed Challenge. My analytical skills extend to portfolio management, where I have explored Warren Buffett-style value investing.
